Fail in Public
==============

### An Extension That Turns Your Code Errors Into Viral Posts. For Science.

Ever feel like your code errors are a masterpiece? Now they can be. The Fail in Public VS Code extension is a fun and comedic tool that takes your C++ errors, sends them to an AI, and posts the hilarious results on a public website for everyone to see. Because a bug shared is a bug... well, still a bug, but at least now it's funny.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

It's a simple and transparent process:

1.  You run your C++ code in VS Code.

2.  An error occurs, and the extension catches the raw error message.

3.  The error message is sent to a backend API.

4.  The API sends the message to Grok AI, which crafts a humorous post based on the error.

5.  This new, funny message is sent back to the API and posted on the Fail in Public website.

6.  Your username and the AI-generated post appear on the site for everyone to enjoy.

### üöß Known Limitations

As this project is in its early stages, it has a few limitations:

-   C++ Only: Currently, the extension only supports catching errors for C++ code.

-   No User Controls: There are no settings or filters to prevent specific errors from being posted.

-   No Deletion: Once a failure is posted to the website, it cannot be deleted from the extension.

-   Basic Website: The website is not fully functional and simply displays the latest error posts.
